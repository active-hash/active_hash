  - Added support for auto-defining methods based on hash keys in ActiveHash::Base
  - Changed the :field and :fields API so that they don't overwrite existing methods (useful when ActiveHash auto-defines methods)
  - Fixed a bug where ActiveFile incorrectly set the root_path to be the path in the gem directory, not the current working directory

  - ActiveFile no longer reloads files by default
  - Added ActiveFile.reload_active_file= so you can cause ActiveFile to reload
