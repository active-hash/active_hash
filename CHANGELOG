2010-04-25
  - When ActiveRecord model belongs_to an ActiveHash and the associated id is nil, returns nil instead of raising RecordNotFound (Jeremy Weiskotten)
  - Merged Nakajima's "add" alias for "create" - gotta save those ASCII characters :)

2010-03-01

  - added support for Hash-style yaml (think, Rails fixtures)
  - added setter for parent object on belongs_to ( city = City.new; city.state = State.first; city.state_id == State.first.id )

2009-10-12
  - auto-assign fields after calling data= instead of after calling .all
  - remove require 'rubygems', so folks with non-gem setups can still use AH
  - added more specific activesupport dependency to ensure that metaclass is available
  - AH no longer calls to_i on ids.  If you pass in a string as an id, you'll get a string back
  - Fancy finders, such as find_all_by_id_and_name, will compare the to_s values of the fields, so you can pass in strings
  - You can now use ActiveHash models as the parents of polymorphic belongs_to associations
  - save, save!, create and create! now add items to the in-memory collection, and naively adds autoincrementing id
  - new_record? returns false if the record is part of the collection
  - ActiveHash now works with Fixjour!

  - Changed the :field and :fields API so that they don't overwrite existing methods (useful when ActiveHash auto-defines methods)
  - Fixed a bug where ActiveFile incorrectly set the root_path to be the path in the gem directory, not the current working directory

2009-07-24
  - ActiveFile no longer reloads files by default
  - Added ActiveFile.reload_active_file= so you can cause ActiveFile to reload
  - Setting data to nil correctly causes .all to return an empty array
  - Added reload(force) method, so that you can force a reload from files in ActiveFile, useful for tests
